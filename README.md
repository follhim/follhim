# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seungju Kim

I'm an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying religiousness/spirituality and mental health in diverse populations through advanced quantitative methods. My work focuses on scale development, SEM, and multilevel modeling.

I'm currently a PhD student in the Clinical/Community Psychology program at the University of Illinois under Dr. Nathan Todd. Feel free to reach out and check out my [website](https://follhim.github.io/) for more.
